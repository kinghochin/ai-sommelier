# 🍷 AI-Powered Sommelier: Wine Pairing Assistant

This project is part of a series exploring how to build a smart, personalized wine-pairing assistant using AI agents, real-time data, and modern LLM tooling.

It uses:
- **LangChain** for orchestrating prompts and tools
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to inject fresh, domain-specific knowledge
- **WebBaseLoader** to fetch live data from sites like Waitrose and Majestic Wine
- **Streamlit** to deliver an interactive, web-based demo
- **Docker** for simple one-command setup
